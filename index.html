                <h4><strong>JavaScript Basics</strong></h4>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
                    for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
                    developers to take it in bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                    environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                    to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup
                        you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript
                        variables must pe identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x
                        ;</li>
                    <li> Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can
                        now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator
                        assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li>
                    <li>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to
                        know the data type. There are six data types
                        that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true false; null - null aka nothing; Number 42 or
                        3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!";Array [1, 'Coding', 2, Dojo']; and Object - {first name:
                        'Jane', last _name: 'Doe'}</li>
                    <li>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions
                        - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
                        conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
                        statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify
                        a new condition to test ,if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all
                        essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have
                        to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li>Function Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run
                        that code block. Think of it as list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting
                        together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the
                        legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                        instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over
                        and over again</li>
